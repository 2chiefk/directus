# Relationship

This pane is only shown when configuring relational fields (including images and translations). Depending on the type of
relationship, you'll be presented with one of the following set of options:

- [Many-to-One](/configuration/relationships/#many-to-one-m2o)
- [One-to-Many](/configuration/relationships/#one-to-many-o2m)
- [Many-to-Many](/configuration/relationships/#many-to-many-m2m)
- [Many-to-Any](/configuration/relationships/#many-to-many-m2m)
- [Translations](/configuration/relationships/#translations-o2m)
- [One-to-One]()

::: tip Corresponding Field

[Relationships go both ways](/configuration/relationships/#perspective-matters), so when creating a new relation Field,
Directus offers to automatically create the corresponding Field on the related Collection.
