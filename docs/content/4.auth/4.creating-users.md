# Creating Users

A user is an item in the `directus_users` collection. There are no required fields by default, although you may choose to require values for any system or user-created fields.

<!-- TODO: IMAGE - user detail page -->

To log in with an `email` and `password` they must be set on the user item. A user can also have a [role](/auth/access-control) assigned in the user detail page.

## Creating Users via API

The Users API can also create a new user.

```json [POST /users]
{
	"email": "hello@example.com",
	"password": "d1r3ctu5",
	"role": "c86c2761-65d3-43c3-897f-6f74ad6a5bd7"
}
```

::callout{type="api-reference" url="/api-reference/users/post/users"}
See all parameters and payload options for the create user endpoint.
::

## Inviting Users

<!-- TODO: IMAGE - inviting users -->

Inviting a user will send an email with an invite URL. Once invited, the user will be created with the provided email address and a status of `invited`. When a user accepts their invite they must provide a password and will be able to log in.

```json [POST /users/invite]
{
	"email": "hello@example.com",
	"role": "c86c2761-65d3-43c3-897f-6f74ad6a5bd7"
}
```

::callout{type="dev-docs" url="/configuration/email"}
An email service must be configured to send invites.
::

### Seamless Invites

You can use the invite system within your own application ensuring users do not need to access the Data Studio.

When using the invite user endpoint, add an `invite_url` property. The invite email will use this URL instead of your Directus project, appending the invite token in the URL as a `token` parameter.

Your application must extract this value, collect the new user's password, and send both to the accept invite endpoint.

```json [POST /users/invite/accept]
{
	"token": "eyJh...KmUk",
	"password": "d1r3ctu5"
}
```

::callout{type="dev-docs" url="/configuration/security-cors"}
The `USER_INVITE_URL_ALLOW_LIST` environment variable must be configured.
